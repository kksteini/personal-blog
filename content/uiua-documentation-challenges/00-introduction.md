## What is this?

I'm learning something new, **the array based programming language
uiua**, and I'd like to document it. I'm doing it for myself but
I'm hoping it can **help others** too.

### It looks like this

```uiua
⍥◡+9∩1
```

Wowee, that is confusing. Informally, each glyph corresponds to an action. Once you've seen them often enough, reading becomes easier. Do not worry if you can't understand this right now.

#### But how do I type these glyphs?

I recommend the [uiua pad](https://www.uiua.org/pad).

You should go there, write `repeat below add 9 both 1` and then press **run** in the lower right corner of the pad. It should format to be the same as the example above. So

```uiua
repeat # before format
⍥      # after format
```

## Who is this for?

I need things dumbed down because I am not super smart. It doesn't help that I
have **no prior experience with array based languages**.

I think the uiua documentation is pretty good, and I will be linking
it in each chapter, but I did struggle a lot going through each chapter.
